# Gadget-Page-using-HTML-CSS

Initial task was to Create, test and validate an HTML5 document that is the home page of a company that sells lots of different kinds of
widgets and gizmos, and is hoping to soon enter the dohickey and thingy markets. 
My document includes images and descriptions of at least three different example products. 
Demonstrates the use of at least one unordered list, at least one ordered list, and at least one list that has a nested list within it. 
Includes how to use a table and table has at least one item that takes up multiple columns and at least one item that takes up multiple
rows. 
Includes have detailed descriptions of products that are stored in separate documents and are accessible through links from the home
document. All the links that I choose to have in my document point to actual documents (yours or someone else's) that actually exist.
